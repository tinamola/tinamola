# Tina Li
I'm a software engineer with a knack for building powerful web applications and data-driven solutions. My tech stack is a mix of modern web and machine learning technologies, covering both the front-end and back-end worlds.
## Background
My journey began with a computer science degree at Monash College, where I explored the depths of Python, C++, JavaScript and TypeScript. During my degree, I researched natural language processing and multi-agent pathfinding as part of my thesis, acquiring a solid foundation in machine learning and data modeling.

In my work, I gained hands-on experience in the full lifecycle of enterprise application development, combining my programming skills with scalable infrastructure tools. I worked on integrating language frameworks with automation and DevOps practices, using tools like Docker, Azure, and GitHub Actions to build robust, automated solutions.
